This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository.
This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the Spring 2023
installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science. 
Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.
